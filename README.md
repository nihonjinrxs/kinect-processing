# Explorations with the Microsoft Kinect sensor in Processing

This repo contains my explorations with the Microsoft Kinect sensor in Processing.

Much of the start of this work is based on the great tutorials by Daniel Shiffman, 
available at [http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/](http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/).

Everything here is MIT licensed, although some code is based on code in [Daniel Shiffman's
tutorial examples](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing), which
does not have a listed license.
